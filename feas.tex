\caption{Constraints of the ALP (left) and the GRLP for system $Q_S$  with $n=10$, $d=2$, $k=2$, $m=5$, $q(1)=0.2, q(2)=0.4, p=0.2$ and $\alpha=0.98$. In this case $c$ has a uniform distribution.
The dotted and solid lines in the right plot show the inactive and active constraints of the GRLP respectively, the dashed lines in the right plot show the active constraints of the ALP. The feasible region in both cases (ALP \& GRLP) are to the right of the corresponding active constraints.}
