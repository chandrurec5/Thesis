\begin{itemize}
\item A section on RL and Stochastic Approximation.
\item A section on ALP, and weighted $\max$ norm.
\item We should motivate that this thesis is fundamental, in that it looks at how to do prediction and control together with performance guarantees.
\item Order is ADP $\ra$ Value ADP $\ra$ Approximation Architecture/ Methods to compute $\ra$ Goal is control and prediction.
\item Need to clearly explain feature matrix etc etc.
\end{itemize}
