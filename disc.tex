\section{Conclusions}\label{disc}

In this paper, we presented and proved conditions that guarantee the stability of two-timescale 
stochastic approximation algorithms. This problem had not been addressed previously in the
literature. The sufficient conditions turn out to be weaker than those needed
to establish convergence (Chapter 6 of \cite{SA}).
Our stability analysis of two-timescale stochastic approximation is quite general and
may easily be extended
to the case of multi-timescale stochastic approximation, where the number of timescales
is more than two.
