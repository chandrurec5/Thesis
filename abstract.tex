We present {\em the first} sufficient conditions that guarantee stability of 
two-timescale stochastic approximation. 
Our analysis is based on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) method and is an 
extension of the results in \cite{BMSTAB} for single-timescale recursions. Our results extend 
the stability analysis for one-timescale schemes to multi-timescale stochastic approximation algorithms. 
As an application of our result, we show the stability of iterates in a two-timescale stochastic approximation algorithm arising in reinforcement learning.
